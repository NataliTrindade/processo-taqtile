# Turn Page Club

Turn Page Club aims to foster a space for passionate readers to connect over their love of books. Members can read, review, and discuss diverse literary works, sharing ideas and reflections on their reading experiences.

## About the Project

The project encourages in-depth exploration of books through structured questions that encourage critical thinking and meaningful dialogue.

## Discussion Prompts

As part of the Turn Page Club experience, consider the following prompts for book reviews and discussions:

- **What was the most impactful moment in the story for you and why?**
- **How do you identify with the protagonist or other main characters?**
- **What do you think could have been done differently in the narrative?**
- **What were the main themes or messages that you identified in the book?**
- **Would you recommend this book to other readers? Why?**

These prompts aim to guide members in reflecting on their reading journey, encouraging them to delve deeper into the themes, characters, and narrative techniques used by the authors.
